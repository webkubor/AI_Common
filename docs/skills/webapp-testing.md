# Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

## Helper Scripts Available

`scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is absolutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than being ingested into your context window.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach

```
User task → Is it static HTML?
    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors
    │         ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors
    │         └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)
    │
    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is server already running?
            ├─ No → Run: python scripts/with_server.py --help
            │         Then use helper + write simplified Playwright script
            └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:
                    1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
                    2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
                    3. Identify selectors from rendered state
                    4. Execute actions with discovered selectors
```

## Example: Using with_server.py

To start a server, run `--help` first, then use helper:

### Single server:
```bash
python scripts/with_server.py --server "npm run dev" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py
```

### Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):
```bash
python scripts/with_server.py \
  --server "cd backend && python server.py" --port 3000 \
  --server "cd frontend && npm run dev" --port 5173 \
  -- python your_automation.py
```

To create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute
    # ... your automation logic
    browser.close()
```

## Common Pitfall

❌ **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` on dynamic apps
✅ **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection

## Best Practices

- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in `scripts/` can help. These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering your context window. Use `--help` to see usage, then invoke directly.
- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts
- Always close browser when done
- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs
- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`
